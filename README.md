# SWIRL
SWirl Identification by Rotation centers Localization (SWIRL) is an automated vortex identification algorithm based on the clustering of estimated centers of rotation. It employs a new method to accurately estimate the centers of rotation and a grid-adapted version of the Clustering by fast search and find of density peaks (CFSFDP) algorithm to cluster them. 

If you are interested in using the algorithm, feel free to contact me at *jcanivete@ics.uzh.ch* .

If you use the SWIRL code for your publications, please cite the paper *Canivete Cuissa & Steiner, A&A (submitted), 2022*, where more details about the method and the code can be found.

# SWIRL
SWirl Identification by Rotation centers Localization (SWIRL) is an automated vortex identification algorithm based on the clustering of estimated centers of rotation. It employs a new method to accurately estimate the centers of rotation and a grid-adapted version of the Clustering by fast search and find of density peaks (CFSFDP) algorithm to cluster them. More details can be found on Canivete Cuissa & Steiner, A&A (submitted), 2022.

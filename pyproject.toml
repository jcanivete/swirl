description = "The SWirl Identification by Rotation centers Localization (SWIRL) is an automated vortex identification algorithm written in python and based on the _Estimated Vortex Center_ (EVC) method [Canivete Cuissa & Steiner, 2022]. Given a two-dimensional velocity field defined on a Cartesian grid and the grid cell size in physical units, the SWIRL code returns a list with the identified vortical structures and their main properties."
